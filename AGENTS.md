# Next.js + TypeScript Agent Rules

## Project Context

You are building a Next.js 15 App Router application with TypeScript. React Server Components (RSC) are the default. Client Components are an opt-in escape hatch for interactivity, browser APIs, and event handlers. Server Actions handle all mutations.

## Linear Workflow

- Linear workspace and team: `Alfy`.
- Linear project: `bppedia`.
- Linear is the source of truth for issue scope, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and status.
- Use the workflow `Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done`.
- Move an issue to `In Progress` before implementation begins.
- Complete the frontend with mock data and obtain user review before starting dependent backend work.
- After automated verification passes, add verification evidence and move the issue to `Review`.
- Always provide a manual verification checklist to the user at review handoff.
- Never move an issue directly from `In Progress` to `Done`.
- Move an issue from `Review` to `Done` only after the user explicitly confirms the manual review passed.

## Code Style & Structure

- Enable `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`. Never use `any`; use `unknown` with type guards.
- Use `interface` for component props and object shapes. Use `type` for unions, mapped types, and conditional types.
- Use named exports for all components and utilities. Default exports only for `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`.
- Structure component files: exported component → subcomponents → helpers → type definitions → constants.
- Use descriptive auxiliary-verb names for boolean state: `isLoading`, `hasError`, `canSubmit`.

## App Router Conventions

- Use `app/` for all routes. Use route groups `(group)/` for layout sharing without URL segments.
- Co-locate `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, and `not-found.tsx` per route segment.
- Use `template.tsx` instead of `layout.tsx` when you need fresh state on each navigation.
- Use parallel routes (`@slot`) for independent page sections with their own loading/error states.
- Use intercepting routes (`(.)`, `(..)`) for modal patterns that retain the background page URL.

## React Server Components

- Default every component to a Server Component. Add `'use client'` only when unavoidable.
- Reasons to use `'use client'`: event handlers (`onClick`), React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), browser APIs (`localStorage`, `ResizeObserver`).
- Never import server-only modules (Prisma, DB clients, `'server-only'`) in Client Components.
- Compose RSC and Client Components by passing RSC output as `children` to a Client Component wrapper.
- Use `React.Suspense` boundaries to stream parts of the page. Provide meaningful `fallback` skeletons.

## Data Fetching

- Fetch data in `async` Server Components directly. No `useEffect`, no client-side `fetch` to internal APIs.
- Deduplicate identical fetch calls with `React.cache()`: `const getUser = cache(async (id: string) => prisma.user.findUnique(...))`.
- Use `unstable_cache(fn, ['cache-key'], { revalidate: 60, tags: ['users'] })` for long-lived cached data.
- Apply `unstable_noStore()` inside functions that must always return fresh data.
- Waterfall fetches are blocked during SSR — parallelize with `Promise.all([fetchUser(id), fetchPosts(id)])`.

## Server Actions

- Declare Server Actions with `'use server'` at the top of a server-only file or inline in RSC.
- Validate all inputs with Zod at the start of every Server Action. Return early with error details on failure.
- Return typed results: `{ success: true, data: T } | { success: false, error: string }`. Never throw from Server Actions.
- Call `revalidatePath('/path')` or `revalidateTag('tag')` after successful mutations.
- Bind Server Actions to forms with the `action` prop: `<form action={createPostAction}>`.
- Use `useActionState` (React 19) for progressive enhancement with pending, error, and result state.

## Routing & Navigation

- Use `next/link` for all internal navigation. Use `router.push()` from `useRouter` only for programmatic navigation.
- Use `next/navigation`'s `useSearchParams`, `usePathname`, `useParams` in Client Components. Read them server-side from page props.
- Implement dynamic routes with `[param]` for single segments and `[...params]` for catch-all segments.
- Prefetch links automatically with `next/link`. Use `prefetch={false}` for links the user is unlikely to follow.

## Error Handling

- Add `error.tsx` at each route segment that may fail. Accept `error: Error` and `reset: () => void` props.
- Add `not-found.tsx` for 404 states. Call `notFound()` from `next/navigation` to trigger it.
- Log errors in `error.tsx` to an external service (Sentry, Axiom) before rendering the fallback UI.
- Validate all user inputs with Zod on the server in Server Actions. Return structured field errors.

## Performance

- Use `next/image` for all raster images. Set `sizes` to match the rendered layout.
- Use `next/font` with `display: 'swap'` for web fonts. Use CSS variable mode for Tailwind integration.
- Lazy-load Client Components with `dynamic(() => import(...), { loading: () => <Skeleton /> })`.
- Set cache policies with `export const revalidate = 3600` at the route segment level.
- Use `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` on pages that have no dynamic data.

## Security

- Validate and sanitize all data in Server Actions and Route Handlers before processing.
- Add Content Security Policy headers in `next.config.ts` via `headers()`.
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix only for env vars that are safe to expose to the browser.
- Never perform authorization checks only on the client — always verify on the server.
- Protect Server Actions with auth checks: read the session and verify the user owns the resource.

## Testing

- Test Server Components with `vitest` by rendering them as async functions: `const result = await MyPage({ params })`.
- Test Client Components with React Testing Library. Mock `next/navigation` hooks with `vi.mock`.
- Write Playwright end-to-end tests for critical user flows: auth, checkout, form submission.
- Test Server Actions directly: call the function with typed inputs, assert returned results and side effects.
